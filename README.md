# YouRtube

*YouRtube, like Youtube but better*


## Description


This is the API of yourtube, a clown of YouTube, but which solves the main problems of YouTube.

The main problems are:
- lots of uninteresting videos 
- no ability to manage video categories
- no possibility to manage languages
- too many shorts
- too much mainstream video pushes

Another main problem is parental control: to allow a child to have access only to educational videos without any possibility of going off-piste.

Last important feature, to be considered in the long term, the possibility of creating a community around videos which are identified as qualitative, not videos which create a buzz, not mainstream videos.
